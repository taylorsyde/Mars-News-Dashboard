# Mission to Mars

This simple web application complies Mars News from various websites, stores it locally in a Mongo database, and displays the information in a single HTML page. Fans of the Dear Hank and John podcast will find this particularly useful. 

## Dashboard Details
- Displayed the 4 most recent Mars news stories from [Red Planet Science](https://redplanetscience.com)
- Provides the user with high resolution images of all four of the Martian hemispheres from [Astropedia](https://marshemispheres.com).
- Displays the [JPL](https://spaceimages-mars.com) 'Featured Image of the Day.'

Please review my [Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/taylorsyde/Mars-News-Dashboard/blob/main/Mission_to_Mars/scrape.ipynb) for details on my web scraping process.
